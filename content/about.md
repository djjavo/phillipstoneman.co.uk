			<h2>PHILLIP STONEMAN</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Hello, my name is Phillip Stoneman (Phil) and I love radio.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am BBC Hereford &amp; Worcester's Station Sound producer; I make jingles, trails, general bits of furniture (the radio kind, not the IKEA-kind) and generally knit together output at the local radio station for Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also produce the weekly BBC Introducing programme with Andrew Marston, supporting local performers. In previous years I have also produced the station's Afternoon and Evening programmes.
			</p>
			<p>
				I started out as a freelance Assistant Producer at BBC Asian Network, whilst also putting up gazebos and doing various social media bits at other radio stations in the Midlands.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’ve been based in the Midlands for a decade (I'm originally from Devon #creamfirst). I studied Economics at the University of Warwick, when I joined its student radio station and fell in love with the medium of radio.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I’m not at the BBC you can find me baking homemade shortbread at home, or - on a Saturday afternoon at BHBN Radio, the hospital station for Birmingham’s seven hospitals, hosting the weekly sport show.
			</p>
