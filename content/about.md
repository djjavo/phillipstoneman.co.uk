			<h2>PHILLIP STONEMAN</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Hello, my name is Phillip Stoneman (Phil) and I love radio.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently you’ll find me making jingles, trails and making the furniture (the radio kind, not the IKEA-kind) at BBC Hereford & Worcester. In previous years I have also produced its Afternoon and Evening programmes.
			</p>
			<p>
				I started out as a freelance Assistant Producer at BBC Asian Network, whilst also putting up gazebos and doing various social media bits at other radio stations in the Midlands.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’ve been based in the Midlands for the best part of a decade; having studied Economics at Warwick University, which was when I joined its student radio station and fell in love with the medium of radio.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I’m not at the BBC you can find me baking homemade shortbread or - on a Saturday afternoon at BHBN Radio, the hospital station for Birmingham’s seven hospitals, hosting the weekly sport show.
			</p>
