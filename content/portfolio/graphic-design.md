<h4>ABOUT THE WORK</h4>
<p>
	I have been using Adobe Photoshop regularly for nearly five years. From first playing around to create graphics for my student radio show, I regularly use it to assemble assets for BHBN Hospital Radio and was entrusted by Community Station Bay FM to turn their ideas in to visual form for use in promotional material.

	One of my favourite graphics designed almost from scratch was for a Capel’s Fish and Chips advert on a website banner for Bay FM. The local company has a fantastic product, but had no logo other than their brand name, and for a fish and chips shop, you need a picture of a fish and chips! I decided to therefore use what I knew to create the shapes I visualised and the colours and shading I knew I could create in my head, and on to the screen of a laptop.
