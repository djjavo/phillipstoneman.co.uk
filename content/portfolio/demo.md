<h4>ABOUT THE WORK</h4>
<p>
	I've worked around the radio industry for over five years, and have accrued substantial experience on-air – from presenting and producing my own show, to reading news and travel bulletins, and reporting from various locations, from charity events to a big (and almost world-record-setting) pair of pants. I am also more than happy to play second fiddle to a presenter, as a pundit or an additional voice to complement a piece.
</p>
<p>
	I love being around a studio, and driving desks – even if I am not the one behind the microphone! Enjoy some selected highlights of my time on-air over the past year.
