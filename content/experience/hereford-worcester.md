<h4>ABOUT THE ROLE</h4>
<p>Since April 2016, I’ve been around BBC Hereford & Worcester in some way shape or form – I started putting up gazebos for the EU referendum – I now knit the station together in Station Sound.</p>

<p>
	I have produced the Afternoon and Evening programmes; I still produce the BBC Introducing programmes. I’ve also been running around behind the scenes at a great many Christmas light switch-ons, OBs and Children in Need events.
</p>
<p>
	On an editorial note, highlights include bringing about a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p09gr2rg" target="_blank">virtual festival</a>, changing jingle packages and branding & launching three new programmes.
</p>
<p>
	Other cool fun moments include visiting Toyah’s house on location(!), launching the evening show’s Kitchen Discos, and picking up some awards. In 2020 we won Station Of The Year at the ARIAs (I was there!) and alongside my awesome mentor (and Radio God) Mike Wyer, we took home Excellence In Production (Silver) in the Frank Gillard Awards 2017. The judges said back then:

<p>
	<i>An excellent example of station sound defining a solid brand identity. High production values, creative writing and excellent use of SFX created a top entry.</i>
</p>

<p>
	All over output, I’ve reported out and about, written & read live travel, reported music, scheduled music and even pretended to fly in a hot air balloon over the villages of Herefordshire & Worcestershire.
