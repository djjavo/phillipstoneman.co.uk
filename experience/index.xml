I have produced programmes of nearly every hour in the schedule over five years, from weekend breakfast to evening- and specialist language- programming. I love being a part of a national broadcaster with international reach. There's the challenge of securing guests and managing studios when connecting guests from lines around the world, in addition to revelling in a music scene that’s not in my first language!</description></item><item><title>Bay FM</title><link>/experience/bay-fm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/experience/bay-fm/</guid><description>ABOUT THE ROLE After spending part of my university holidays with my home community station, Exmouth-based Bay FM, I continued to volunteer for them, producing high quality, coherent and distinctive social media assets and artwork, used in on-air and print publicity. Despite being based in Birmingham, I would enjoy using my graphic design skills to assist one of Devon's largest community stations, keeping my experience sharp and forcing me to overcome new challenges – for instance, creating my very own shapes for a burger and chips, in the creation of a competition graphic.</description></item><item><title>BBC Radio 2</title><link>/experience/bbc-radio-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/experience/bbc-radio-2/</guid><description>ABOUT THE ROLE When my soon-to-be work experience supervisor called me in the summer of 2014 to say I'd have four weeks working at the UK's biggest radio station, I couldn't ever have anticipated what would be next.
I helped to prepare shows for one of the station's biggest events and OBs of the year: Live in Hyde Park. I helped collaborate production notes on the artists performing – and was part of the production teams producing live shows in between acts backstage, including Chris Evans' pre-ELO warm-up show.</description></item><item><title>BHBN</title><link>/experience/bhbn/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/experience/bhbn/</guid><description>ABOUT THE ROLE After graduation, I moved to Birmingham and wanted to keep my radio skills sharp whilst still in the early stages of my radio career – I joined the sport team as something different, despite no strong affiliation to a football club – but knew I could add value with my familiarity with the studio environment and radio production skills. Two and a bit years later, I have started my second year on its board of directors, am a regular presence on-air on Saturday afternoons – with BHBN Sport during the football season &amp;amp; Living Up the Weekend in the summer months – and have supported the station for some of its biggest events.</description></item><item><title>Hereford &amp; Worcester</title><link>/experience/hereford-worcester/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/experience/hereford-worcester/</guid><description>ABOUT THE ROLE Since October 2016, I have been part of the Station Sound team, producing imagery and trails, embracing the station’s branding – that espouses localness, storytelling and – above all – fun.
Highlights include creating a sound for three new shows to the station, developing new campaigns and new ways to showcase the best of our schedule – from our coverage of Worcestershire County Cricket in 2017, to the Sunday Nights mix of Jazz and Love Songs.</description></item><item><title>RAW 1251AM</title><link>/experience/radio-warwick/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/experience/radio-warwick/</guid><description>ABOUT THE ROLE I threw myself in to student radio for three years alongside my course at the University of Warwick. From presenting my own primetime award-winning show, to reading the news, adding to the station’s imaging and creating social media assets, at RaW 1251AM I truly discovered my passion for making great radio.
I took the opportunity to become part of the society’s committee in 2013 as its Head of Production, and a year later as its Secretary &amp;amp; Deputy Station Manager – presiding at Acting Station Manager for three months – in the year our 100 hour February charity broadcast raised over £1500 and I ran our annual society ball-come-awards ceremony, increasing capacity by 20% - and still selling all seats!</description></item></channel></rss>
