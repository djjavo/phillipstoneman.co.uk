				<h4>ABOUT THE ROLE</h4>
				<p>When my soon-to-be work experience supervisor called me in the summer of 2014 to say I'd have four weeks working at the UK's biggest radio station, I couldn't ever have anticipated what would be next.</p>

					I helped to prepare shows for one of the station's biggest events and OBs of the year: Live in Hyde Park. I helped collaborate production notes on the artists performing â€“ and was part of the production teams producing live shows in between acts backstage, including Chris Evans' pre-ELO warm-up show.
				</p>
				<p>
					I worked across the weekend shows, taking in and picking the brains of Huey Morgan's, Elaine Paige's, Liza Tarbuck's, Anneka Rice's, Graham Norton's and Terry Wogan's production teams. I took so many fond memories from shadowing all of the shows, especially the latter - to sit behind the glass wall of Sir Terry Wogan was an honour and something I will never forget.
