I have been at the network for two years, preparing content for and studio producing the wide array of Birmingham-based shows – from the fast-paced weekend breakfast, to afternoons, specialist language, and late night entertainment. I love being a part of a national broadcaster with international reach.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>PHILLIP STONEMAN Integral part of BBC Hereford &amp;amp; Worcester's award-winning Station Sound team, freelance Assistant Producer at BBC Asian Network and Warwick Economics graduate.

Despite being based in Birmingham, I would enjoy using my graphic design skills to assist one of Devon's largest community stations, keeping my experience sharp and forcing me to overcome new challenges – for instance, creating my very own shapes for a burger and chips, in the creation of a competition graphic.</description></item><item><title>BBC Radio 2</title><link>/bbc-radio-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/bbc-radio-2/</guid><description>BBC RADIO 2 WORK EXPERIENCE ABOUT THE ROLE When my soon-to-be work experience supervisor called me in the summer of 2014 to say I'd have four weeks working at the UK's biggest radio station, I couldn't ever have anticipated what would be next.
I helped to prepare shows for one of the station's biggest events and OBs of the year: Live in Hyde Park. I helped collaborate production notes on the artists performing – and was part of the production teams producing live shows in between acts backstage, including Chris Evans' pre-ELO warm-up show.</description></item><item><title>BHBN</title><link>/bhbn/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/bhbn/</guid><description>BHBN HOSPITAL RADIO SPORTS EDITOR, HONORARY SECRETARY ABOUT THE ROLE After graduation, I moved to Birmingham and wanted to keep my radio skills sharp whilst still in the early stages of my radio career – I joined the sport team as something different, despite no strong affiliation to a football club – but knew I could add value with my familiarity with the studio environment and radio production skills.</description></item><item><title>BHBN Sport</title><link>/bhbn-sport/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/bhbn-sport/</guid><description>BHBN SPORT BHBN HOSPITAL RADIO ABOUT THE WORK Since I started living in Birmingham, I wanted to continue my passion of "doing radio". I was recommended its hospital radio station, and joined the sport team as someone who knew the ins and outs of a studio, as opposed to a fan of football. However, I quickly developed my sporting punditry skills and would regularly host the four hour Saturday programme, driving the desk as if it was any other show that I had produced.</description></item><item><title>Demo</title><link>/demo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/demo/</guid><description>DEMO BHBN HOSPITAL RADIO &amp;amp; RAW 1251AM ABOUT THE WORK I've worked around the radio industry for over five years, and have accrued substantial experience on-air – from presenting and producing my own show, to reading news and travel bulletins, and reporting from various locations, from charity events to a big (and almost world-record-setting) pair of pants. I am also more than happy to play second fiddle to a presenter, as a pundit or an additional voice to complement a piece.</description></item><item><title>Graphic Design</title><link>/graphic-design/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/graphic-design/</guid><description>GRAPHIC DESIGN BAY FM, RAW 1251AM &amp;amp; BHBN HOSPITAL RADIO ABOUT THE WORK I have been using Adobe Photoshop regularly for nearly five years. From first playing around to create graphics for my student radio show, I regularly use it to assemble assets for BHBN Hospital Radio and was entrusted by Community Station Bay FM to turn their ideas in to visual form for use in promotional material.</description></item><item><title>Hereford &amp; Worcester</title><link>/hereford-worcester/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hereford-worcester/</guid><description>BBC HEREFORD &amp;amp; WORCESTER BROADCAST ASSISTANT, PRODUCTION &amp;amp; STATION SOUND ABOUT THE ROLE Since October 2016, I have been part of the Station Sound team, producing imagery and trails, embracing the station’s branding – that espouses localness, storytelling and – above all – fun.
Highlights include creating a sound for three new shows to the station, developing new campaigns and new ways to showcase the best of our schedule – from our coverage of Worcestershire County Cricket in 2017, to the Sunday Nights mix of Jazz and Love Songs.</description></item><item><title>Living Up The Weekend</title><link>/living-up-the-weekend/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/living-up-the-weekend/</guid><description>LIVING UP THE WEEKEND RAW 1251AM &amp;amp; BHBN HOSPITAL RADIO ABOUT THE WORK My student radio show was arguably where it all began, in November 2012. From my first show, in my first year at RaW 1251AM, my weekly hobby soon blossomed in to one of the station's award-winning primetime shows, packed with plenty of production and quality content. I was able to hone my presenting style, focus my presenting strengths, and learn how best I could use the desk and playout system at my disposal to create a show full of energy and creativity, befitting our student audience over a Saturday lunchtime.</description></item><item><title>RAW 1251AM</title><link>/radio-warwick/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/radio-warwick/</guid><description>RAW 1251AM HEAD OF PRODUCTION &amp;amp; DEPUTY STATION MANAGER ABOUT THE ROLE I threw myself in to student radio for three years alongside my course at the University of Warwick. From presenting my own primetime award-winning show, to reading the news, adding to the station’s imaging and creating social media assets, at RaW 1251AM I truly discovered my passion for making great radio.
I took the opportunity to become part of the society’s committee in 2013 as its Head of Production, and a year later as its Secretary &amp;amp; Deputy Station Manager – presiding at Acting Station Manager for three months – in the year our 100 hour February charity broadcast raised over £1500 and I ran our annual society ball-come-awards ceremony, increasing capacity by 20% - and still selling all seats!</description></item><item><title>Station Sound</title><link>/station-sound/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:54:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>/station-sound/</guid><description>STATION SOUND BBC HEREFORD &amp;amp; WORCESTER ABOUT THE WORK I am part of BBC Hereford &amp;amp; Worcester's Station Sound triad, and took home silver in the BBC's annual Frank Gillard Awards for 'Excellence in Production'. Combining long term planning and honing of campaigns, with short turn around trails to match the "vibe" of the moment, our station voice reflects our presenters on air – fantastic storytelling and entertainment.</description></item></channel></rss>
