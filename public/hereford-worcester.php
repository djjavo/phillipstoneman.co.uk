				<h4>ABOUT THE ROLE</h4>
				<p>Since October 2016, I have been part of the Station Sound team, producing imagery and trails, embracing the station’s branding – that espouses localness, storytelling and – above all – fun.</p>

					Highlights include creating a sound for three new shows to the station, developing new campaigns and new ways to showcase the best of our schedule – from our coverage of Worcestershire County Cricket in 2017, to the Sunday Nights mix of Jazz and Love Songs. We took home Silver in the 2017 Frank Gillard Awards for ‘Excellence in Production’, judges said:

					<i>An excellent example of station sound defining a solid brand identity. High production values, creative writing and excellent use of SFX created a top entry.</i>
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p>
					I take pride in my studio competence and editing proficiency, producing shows across the schedule and across programme genres. I regularly take the opportunity, often despite the time constraints of live shows, to create supplementary audio content that helps to bring items alive. I have good rapport with presenters and the audience, being no stranger to collating and reading travel, and playing my part when needed on-air.
