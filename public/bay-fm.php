				<h4>ABOUT THE ROLE</h4>
				<p>
					After spending part of my university holidays with my home community station, Exmouth-based Bay FM, I continued to volunteer for them, producing high quality, coherent and distinctive <a href="graphic-design.php">social media assets and artwork</a>, used in on-air and print publicity. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite being based in Birmingham, I would enjoy using my graphic design skills to assist one of Devon's largest community stations, keeping my experience sharp and forcing me to overcome new challenges â€“ for instance, creating my very own shapes for a burger and chips, in the creation of a competition graphic. Once the initial idea was approved, different assets would be made, each optimal to social media channels, their website and print.

					I was trusted to design what turned out to be the station's new logo, and would regularly design the station's key piece of physical advertising, a banner covering a roadside trailer.
