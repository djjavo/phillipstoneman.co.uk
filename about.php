				<h2>PHILLIP STONEMAN</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Integral part of BBC Hereford &amp; Worcester's award-winning Station Sound team, freelance Assistant Producer at BBC Asian Network and Warwick Economics graduate.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am diligent, creative and proficient in graphic design, audio editing, social media, radio production and radio presentation. I pride myself on planning long, evolving campaigns, and working to the tightest of deadlines, turning around audio to complement on-air items, plus editing awards entries for radio stations. 
 				</p>
 				<p>
					Radio is also my hobby. From what started out as volunteering, driving the desk for the weekly sports show, I am BHBN Hospital Radio's Honorary Secretary &amp; Sports Editor. I love going the extra mile, from supervising Duke of Edinburgh's expeditions with my old university society, to volunteering with my former local community station to produce digital publicity materials, and perfecting my home-baked shortbread.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you love audio as much as I do, please say hello: I've spent the past five years taking on new challenges, working with new people and taking on board their ideas, and I'm not inclined to stop now. I'm based in the West Midlands and am at your service.
